# POTD
The Problem of the Day (POTD) is a daily coding challenge presented on GeeksforGeeks. The goal is to improve problem-solving skills, enhance coding proficiency, and learn new algorithms and data structures regularly.
Each day, I challenge myself to solve a problem from the GeeksforGeeks POTD collection. The problems cover a wide range of topics, including:

Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, etc.)
Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, etc.)
Mathematics and Logical Puzzles
System Design and Advanced Topics
